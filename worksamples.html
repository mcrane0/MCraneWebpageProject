                <h2>Barren County Schools Tech Office</h2>
                <p>In the first picture to the left is me replacing the broken screen of a school Chromebook, one of the many things I do for the Barren County Tech Office since I started in the spring semester of my freshman year. Being a part of the Tech Office has allowed me to grow as a communicator when helping staff members with their technical issues and become more creative in how I troubleshoot problems that arise. In the second picture to the left I can be seen adding a note to the Chromebook’s work order stating that I’ve repaired the screen; this is very important in terms of teamwork, as I’m letting others in the tech office know that the Chromebook has been fixed.</p>

                <h2>Journal Guide - Mental Health Journaling Program</h2>
                <p>In my sophomore year for my AP Computer Science Principles class, as part of the AP Exam, we were assigned the Create Task, where we create some sort of program using the different methods and strategies that we learned. For this, I decided to make a mental health journal using <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> that guides you through how to express yourself, something that I find very important. This would be aptly named “Journal Guide”. Due being unable to create a program with a graphical user interface (GUI), I worked to make an intuitive command-line text editor, the heart of Journal Guide. To save the journals that users created, I made my own file format, .jgd, that journals could be saved to and opened from. So they can also be saved as an easy to read and universal format, they are given the option to save as a .txt (text) file. Below is a video of me using Journal Guide. Through writing all 312 lines of code (some can be seen below), I learned more about creating an experience that's welcoming for the user, coming up with creative solutions to the problems faced in coding, and more about the Python language and using it in general.</p>

                <h2><i>A Christmas Story: The Musical</i></h2>
                <p>Since middle school, I have always been a big fan of my friends' roles in theatre, and in my senior year, I finally joined them in the Barren County High School Drama Club. I didn't join to act, but instead to bring them my ability with technology. When I started helping, Ms. Gardner, the director, asked me to hook up a camera set up behind the audience to two TVs backstage, so the others backstage could see what’s happening onstage. I expected she would give me a modern camcorder that I'd use with a straightforward connection to the TVs, until she handed me a camcorder from 2001, seen in the first picture to the left. Still, I worked with her idea and found a converter for the camcorder’s analog video signal to a modern digital signal, used what I learned in Helpdesk to create two very long cables, and successfully gave everyone backstage a view of what was happening onstage. Next, I handled capturing scenes done backstage live on camera and displayed them to the screens in the auditorium, and created cards to show on the screens. Through all of that, I had so much fun, and would like to thank all the amazing people in drama for making it so, and I'm looking forward to doing it again in the spring for <i>Cinderella</i>. </p>
