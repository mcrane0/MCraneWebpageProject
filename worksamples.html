                <h2>Barren County Schools Tech Office</h2>
                <p>In the first picture to the left is me replacing the broken screen of a school Chromebook, one of the many things I do for the Barren County Tech Office since I started in the spring semester of my freshman year. Being a part of the Tech Office has allowed me to grow as a communicator when helping staff members with their technical issues and become more creative in how I troubleshoot problems that arise. In the second picture to the left I can be seen adding a note to the Chromebook’s work order stating that I’ve repaired the screen; this is very important in terms of teamwork, as I’m letting others in the tech office know that the Chromebook has been fixed.</p>

                <h2>Journal Guide - Mental Health Journaling Program</h2>
                <p>In my sophomore year for my AP Computer Science Principles class, as part of the AP Exam, we were assigned the Create Task, where we create some sort of program using the different methods and strategies that we learned. For this, I decided to make a mental health journal using <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> that guides you through how to express yourself, something that I find very important. This would be aptly named “Journal Guide”. Due being unable to create a program with a graphical user interface (GUI), I worked to make an intuitive command-line text editor, the heart of Journal Guide. To save the journals that users created, I made my own file format, .jgd, that journals could be saved to and opened from. So they can also be saved as an easy to read and universal format, they are given the option to save as a .txt (text) file. Below is a video of me using Journal Guide. Through writing all 312 lines of code (some can be seen below), I learned more about creating an experience that's welcoming for the user, coming up with creative solutions to the problems faced in coding, and more about the Python language and using it in general.</p>

                <h2><i>A Christmas Story: The Musical</i></h2>
                <p>Since middle school, I have always been a big fan of my friends' roles in theatre, and in my senior year, I finally joined them in the Barren County High School Drama Club. I didn't join to act, but instead to bring them my ability with technology. When I started helping, Ms. Gardner, the director, asked me to hook up a camera set up behind the audience to two TVs backstage, so the others backstage could see what’s happening onstage. I expected she would give me a modern camcorder that I'd use with a straightforward connection to the TVs, until she handed me a camcorder from 2001, seen in the first picture to the left. Still, I worked with her idea and found a converter for the camcorder’s analog video signal to a modern digital signal, used what I learned in Helpdesk to create two very long cables, and successfully gave everyone backstage a view of what was happening onstage. My work with cameras didn't stop there; I captured scenes acted live backstage with a different albeit much more modern camcorder, and displayed them to the screens in the auditorium. Below is a picture of me testing out connection to the screens. To give even more to the show, I designed cards which I would display on the screens between acts, before, and after the show, like the one for the start of Act Two seen below. I had so much fun through all the work I did on this production, and I'm looking forward to doing it again in the spring for <i>Cinderella</i>. </p>

                <h2>mcrane.website</h2>
                <p>The website you are currently looking at is a work sample. This was part of an assignment where I had to create a website about myself to then present to a panel. Chances are, you reading this right now are part of said panel.</p>
                <p>Most people used Wix to create their website for this assignment. Given that the point of this website was to demonstrate how we're college and career ready and fit the <a href="profiletrojan.html">"Profile of a Trojan"</a>, I decided to take a more creative approach and make my website the way I'm going to be pursuing a career in: programming.</p>
                <p>I wrote my website from scratch using HTML and CSS. All styles and designs were made by me, with exception of some colors taken from color palette websites and the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> (a code editor) color theme to give a programming feel to the website. It was difficult to create all the designs I wanted from just code, especially compared to something you graphically interact with like Wix, however anything that went wrong on my website was something that I could eventually fix, and not be helpless against whatever issues Wix had with its buggy system.</p>
                <p>To make the website accessible, I uploaded the code to <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> (a place for uploading code), which has a feature allowing me to publish the website, and configure it with a low-cost domain, "<a href="https://mcrane.website/">mcrane.website</a>", and now my website is up and on the web.</p>
                <p>The full code for my website can be viewed on <a href="https://github.com/mcrane0/MCraneWebpageProject">GitHub</a>, and some of it for this work samples page can be seen in a picture to the right.</p>
