                <h2>Barren County Schools Tech Office</h2>
                <p>In the first picture to the left is me replacing the broken screen of a school Chromebook, one of the many things I do for the Barren County Tech Office since I started in the spring semester of my freshman year. Being a part of the Tech Office has allowed me to grow as a communicator when helping staff members with their technical issues and become more creative in how I troubleshoot problems that arise. In the second picture to the left I can be seen adding a note to the Chromebook’s work order stating that I’ve repaired the screen; this is very important in terms of teamwork, as I’m letting others in the tech office know that the Chromebook has been fixed.</p>

                <h2>Journal Guide - Mental Health Journaling Program</h2>
                <p>In my sophomore year for my AP Computer Science Principles class, as part of the AP Exam, we were assigned the Create Task, where we create some sort of program using the different methods and strategies that we learned. For this, I decided to make a mental health journal using <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> that guides you through how to express yourself, something that I find very important. This would be aptly named “Journal Guide”. Due being unable to create a program with a graphical user interface (GUI), I worked to make an intuitive command-line text editor, the heart of Journal Guide. To save the journals that users created, I made my own file format, .jgd, that journals could be saved to and opened from. So they can also be saved as an easy to read and universal format, they are given the option to save as a .txt (text) file. To the right is a video of me using Journal Guide. Through writing all 312 lines of code (some can be seen to the left), I learned more about creating an experience that's welcoming for the user, coming up with creative solutions to the problems faced in coding, and more about the Python language and using it in general.</p>
